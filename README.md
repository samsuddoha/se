# Software Engineering & Information System Design

## 🆕 Introduction
Welcome to the **Software Engineering & Information System Design** course for the undergraduate **Computer Science program** at the **University of Barishal**.  
This repository contains all course materials, including lecture slides, assignments, projects, and important announcements. Offered in **Fall 2025**, this course is divided into two parts:
- **CSE-3103: Software Engineering & Information System Design (Theory, 3 credits)**
- **CSE-3104: Software Engineering & Information System Design Lab (Lab, 1.5 credits)**

In the theory course, you’ll learn fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, along with essential algorithms for data management and optimization.

The lab course will complement this by providing hands-on programming experience using (C, C++ or Python), where you’ll implement these structures and strengthen your problem-solving skills.

## 📝 Description
Throughout this course, you will lean:
- Understand the **software development lifecycle (SDLC)**.
- Learn how to **gather requirements**, **design systems**, and **manage projects**.
- Apply **UML modeling**, **testing strategies**, and **software quality practices**.
- Gain hands on experience through **real world projects** and version control with **Git & GitHub**.
